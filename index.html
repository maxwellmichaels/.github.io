	<h1>Make Extra Money From Using Solar Energy</h1>
		<p>You can make extra money by selling your SREC's once your Solar Panels are paid off! An SREC stands for Solar Renewable Energy Credit.
			SREC's are earned as an additional benefit for using clean energy. You can estimate how many SREC's you can earn by multiplying the kilowatt size of the system by 1.2.
			 You earn one SREC for every 1,000 kilowatt hours produced by your system. Each SREC can be worth upwards of $400 in certain states!
			There are upfront incentives including 30% federal investment tax credit and $1,000 in local rebates that can cut down the cost!
			</p>
	<h1>Our Impact</h1>
		<p>Alternative energy sources that don't cause pollution are a great way to benefit our Earth and create a positive long-term impact! According to <a href="epa.gov">The Environmental Protection Agency</a> 31% of our total US greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity generation. 
			We need to reduce this by reducing fossil fuels. 
		</p>
	<h1>How Do We Calculate?</h1>
		<p>With the help of the Renewable Energy Calculator you can see how soon your investment will pay off. Our calculation takes into account the installment cost and divides it by the annual bill of non-renewable energy
			to find the amount of time it will take for your energy source to break-even. Our calculator assumes that your renewable energy source covers 100% of your energy bill.
